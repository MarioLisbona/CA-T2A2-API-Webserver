## **R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.**

I'm building a forum API to create an online community with an environment that encourages open communication between like minded individuals. The forum will help facilitate this by providing a variety of channels where users can make posts that relate to that channel. Users can also post replies to help continue the conversation with meaningful input from the entire forum community.


Administrators will moderate all the interactions that happen on the platform. This will be vital in maintaining the platform's integrity as an environment where open communication can happen.


Administrators will be able to perform important moderation activities including deactivating/archiving posts that are inactive, deleting posts, issuing users warnings and deleting users who are violating the community guidelines.


## **R2 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?**

Open and honest communication is vital in creating a world where people from different backgrounds and ethnicities can appreciate and respect the way their fellow members of society interact and view the world we live in.

If an individual is seen to be communicating in an honest way then the person on the other end of that conversation will feel compelled to reciprocate. This kind of communication leads to a world where differences are celebrated rather than criticised. This fusion of different cultural idea and norms can be the catalyst for creativity and innovation in all societies.

Creating a virtual world where this communication can happen is a step towards it happening more often in the real world.
