## **R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.**

I'm building a forum API to create an online community with an environment that encourages open communication between like minded individuals. The forum will help facilitate this by providing a variety of channels where users can make posts that relate to that channel. Users can also post replies to help continue the conversation with meaningful input from the entire forum community.


Administrators will moderate all the interactions that happen on the platform. This will be vital in maintaining the platform's integrity as an environment where open communication can happen.


Administrators will be able to perform important moderation activities including deactivating/archiving posts that are inactive, deleting posts, issuing users warnings and deleting users who are violating the community guidelines.


## **R2 - Why is it a problem that needs solving?**

Open and honest communication is vital in creating a world where people from different backgrounds and ethnicities can appreciate and respect the way their fellow members of society interact and view the world we live in.

If an individual is seen to be communicating in an honest way then the person on the other end of that conversation will feel compelled to reciprocate. This kind of communication leads to a world where differences are celebrated rather than criticised. This fusion of different cultural idea and norms can be the catalyst for creativity and innovation in all societies.

Creating a virtual world where this communication can happen is a step towards it happening more often in the real world. (John E Hind, 2022) [^1] 

## **R3 - Why have you chosen this database system. What are the drawbacks compared to others?**

Before a single line of code has been written, developers will have to tackle the challenge of what technologies to use in their application. One of the major decisions that needs to be made before development starts on any application is what database technology to use. Data is the lifeblood of any application and the way that it will be stored, accessed and used by the application will dictate what technologies will be used.

Databases fall into two broad categories, Relational Databases Management Systems (RDBMS) which store data in a tabular format and NoSQL which stores data in document format. 

Cost was a major factor when choosing a database technology for this forum API. PostgreSQL is an open-source cost effective solution that provides a great alternative compared to similar licenced RDBMS. PostgreSQL was also chosen because of its reliability, robustness and its ability to create and use complex queries.

The data structures and fields used by this forum API will remain unchanged when the API is running. Flexibility with regards to input fields and storing data is one of the biggest advantages of using a NoSQL database. Because this flexibility in data fields was not needed in this project, the decision to use PostgreSQl with its schema approach to storing data made more sense. PostgreSQL also has the added advantage of being able to run NoSQL processes because it can query and store JSON. JSON data will be used in the body of all requests and JSON will be returned to the user in all responses.

No solution is ever the perfect solution, there are always drawbacks that need to be weighed against advantages. Postgres is less efficient than other RDBMS because for every new client connection established a new process which allocates 10mb of memory is created. This is a non-trivial amount of memory and if the Forum APIâ€™s user base and activity grows significantly it could become an issue that needs to be addressed. Although PostgreSQL is built with scalability, data integrity and extensibility in mind, these features often come at the expense of speed. For this reason PostgreSQL may not be the ideal solution for simple (no complex queries) workflows that mainly require read operations. PostgreSQL has only a limited number of 3rd party tools. This is because it is the less popular option when it comes to RDBMS solutions. (Amrit Pal Singh, 2021) [^2] (Salman Ravoof, 2022) [^3] (Krasimir Hristozov, 2019) [^4]


## **R4 - Identify and discuss the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM**

An Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is a language specific code module or library that acts as an intermediary between data stored in a relational database and objects created in application code. Below is a table of user data in a PostgreSQL database

```
 id |    f_name     | l_name  |          email          |                           password                           | is_admin | warnings 
----+---------------+---------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+----------+----------
  1 | Administrator | Admin   | admin@forum.com         | $2b$12$nS0KObVyXv8HmKNAtcvBmu2rsXnnqY8BGGOgm2mcXvit7TgmPRp4e | t        |        0
  2 | Mario         | Lisbona | mario.lisbona@gmail.com | $2b$12$.ZF7EmMGNoJBb9bimlCjMum7Os86.ADN8PPS5PTQX1SEd0/lPF02O | f        |        0
  3 | Ali           | Taubner | ali.taubner@gmail.com   | $2b$12$zGkzP1Cjwro0WsW8UTan2.07ZmRJqPnkiMczKRtCCJOBDysm5rEsW | f        |        0
  4 | Coda          | Cat     | coda.cat@gmail.com      | $2b$12$Tw5Bo2CrbAgPaWGtf8oQU.4uj7zGYi6ZkOs5.aOTX6p06s4ZudVmW | f        |        0
```

Using an ORM the following class would be created to map to the each record in the database table. 

```py
class User(db.Model):

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    f_name = db.Column(db.String(100))
    l_name = db.Column(db.String(100))
    email = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False, unique=True)
    password = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
    warnings = db.Column(db.Integer, default=0)
```
For each new record in the table, a new instnace of the User class would be created and each field's data would be entered into each attribute of the object. For example the object below would be used to create user id 2.

```py
user = User(
        f_name = 'Mario',
        l_name = 'Lisbona',
        email = 'mario.lisbona@gmail.com',
        password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash('muz123').decode('utf-8'),
        is_admin = False,
        warnings = 0
      )
```

Object Relational Mapping allows developers to manipulate data structures in databases through Object Orientated Programming languages. This means that developers can use the language of their choice to perform CRUD operations on the databases instead of having to write SQL statements. For example the below SQL statement will count the number of posts that are marked as active in a 'posts' table:
```SQL
SELECT count (*)
FROM posts
WHERE is_active = true;
```
The equvilent code in an Python using SQLAlchemy would look like this:

```py
stmt = stmt = db.select(db.func.count()).select_from(Post).filter_by(is_active=True)
```

Using an ORM to read and manipulate data from a database a process called 'hydration' which converts the value of each column of the database table into an object property. This property can now be manipulate and used in the application code. The ORM will then be used in reverse to convert the manipulate data back into a format to be used in the database. 

ORM's use one of two patterns, either Active Record or Data Mapper. Active Record and Data Mapper patterns are similar in that each will have a class that represents the table in the database. The classes attributes correspond to columns in the database table. This means that every object instance is effectively linked to a single row or record in that table. Active record differs from Data Mapper here in that it not only contains the data for each attribute of record, it also contains methods to perform on that data (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

This ability to query the database and develop and application in the one language has the potential to speed up the development of an application in its early stages because the developers aren't having to swap back and forth between the language the application is coded in and the language used to query the database structures. ORM's also are database platform agnostic so that an application can be built with one type of database and then switched to a different database with minimal changes to the application code. Although in theory its possible to use, for example PostgreSQL in a staging environment and then swap to MySQL in a production environment without too much hassle, this is not a good practice as unforeseen errors could occur in the production environment that weren't tested for in the staging environment.

Prevention of SQL injection attacks is another benefit provided by using an ORM to interact with a database. It by no means provides total protection against SQL injection attacks but significantly reduced the chance of it happening because the interactions with the database are happening in the application code not in SQL.

To manage all the tasks for this project is used a kanban board on Trello. I first created the users stories below that apply to the forum API. All the tasks that need to be completed in the project, including all the documentation, answers to assignment questions and the actual coding of different routes for the API are assigned to tickets and placed in the backlog column. I then assigned different coloured labels for different groups of tasks, green for R1, R2, R3  assignment rubrics, purple for assignment requirements to check, yellow for optional features after the minimum viable product was complete and orange for coding tasks. This allowed me to get a get a quick overview of of the project by showing where different tasks and groups of tasks where located in the cycle of the kanban board.

I then wrote all the user stories for the API. The user stories below are broken down into two classes of users that will be accessing the forum API, Administrator and user, and represent all the different routes to resources that the API will facilitate.

| User          	| Action                                                                                                 	|

I then created a kanban board with Trello to allocate and track tasks for the duration of the project. The kanban board is comprised of 5 columns, from left to right they are:
- Backlog
- To Do
- Doing
- Testing
- Done

<br>

<img src="./docs/kanban-columns.png" width='900' alt="kanban columns">

I set Work In Progress limits (WIP's) on the columns to track how many tasks where in each stage of the project. Once the kanban board was setup i would move tasks or tickets from the backlog column into the todo until that was full. At this stage i would give each ticket a date for the work to be completed by. Then i would take a task/tasks fro To Do and place it in the Doing column and then begin on the task. I added checklists for the more complicated tasks to keep track of each sub-task that would need to be completed before that ticket could be moved to the testing and Done columns.

If any completed features needed refactoring or their scope changed, then i would move the ticket back to the To Do column, adjust the checklists, date and the process would start again for that task.



You can become a member of my T2A2 Web API trello board [*here*](https://trello.com/invite/b/tgZAzcbl/ATTI8dca09e313c793fbac3a556003958f8aC962B77D/t2a2-api-webserver) to view all the tickets that were created.
